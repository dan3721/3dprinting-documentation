This was my first big project consisting of multiple parts. The model and related files obtained from
<a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-star-trek-uss-enterprise-ncc-1701-88991">MyMiniFactory: Star
    Trek USS Enterprise NCC 1701</a> which was done by <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/users/dsk001">Dsk</a>
who did an absolutely amazing job. It was a really fun project. Additionally the variety of parts afforded a great
opportunity to dive deeper into the various slicing options and helped me to hone my printing techniques.

<h2>"Main Hull"</h2>

<a href="main-hull.jpg"><img height="300" src="main-hull.jpg"/></a>

<p>
    Hummm what's up here with this zitting? See <a href="../../troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#10">Surface Pocking
    (Erratic Nozzle Travel)</a>.
    Maybe I'll reprint this again later to get a better print but, it's not the Sistine Chapel so let's move on...

<h2>"Secondary Hull"</h2>

<p>
    I made a few attempts here and had significant difficulties with zitt-ing and ringing. <i>Note the glued seam. This
    was a learning exercise for me and I was testing the strength of layer adhesion and getting an idea of what
    the breaking point was. Let's just say I found it.</i>
</p>
<a href="zitting-and-ringing.jpg"><img height="300" src="zitting-and-ringing.jpg"/></a>
<p>
    First I focused on the zits and after trying to tweak a few settings related to retraction, I finally broke away and
    built a <a href="Test Cylinder.scad" download="book.pdf">Test Cylinder</a> in OpenSCAD as it was clear that I would
    need to test drive multiple setting combinations
    and I needed something quick to print and examine. Fooling with the retraction distance and speed, I managed to
    make the zitting worse but not much better. I also tried adjusting the temperature, combing, wipe distance,
    etc. Finally, and I don't know why I did't start with this, I re-leveled the bed which had a positive impact but,
    there were still visible surface anomalies. Upon closer inspection the zits went from protrusions to indentations.
    Perhaps this is just as good as it gets with a random seam? Ultimately my solution was to change the seam
    alignment from "Random" to "Back". Here are a few of the test cylinders with the last showing the vertical seam.
    In actuality for this part, I also selected "Sharpest Conner" for this part which results in hading the seam in the
    windows and other sharp connors on the way up. There are only a few parts for which the circumference is not broken
    by an edge in which to align/hide the seam.
</p>
<p>The first is the current state. The second is a little better due to bed re-leveling). The third is with the seam
    in the back (piece rotated so it can be seen).</p>

<p>Here you can see the seam hidden in a window. The head is about to complete the layer...</p>
<a href="seam-in-window.png"><img class="screen-capture-cura" src="seam-in-window.png"/></a>

<p>The actual print came out like this. Not super and I'm not happy with it but, it will do for now.</p>

<h2>"Second Hull Front"</h2>

<p>Rotated by 180° and set the seam alignment to the back as there are large portions of the z profile
    which unlike the secondary haul are not broken by a conner so might as well align the seam
    directly centered on the underside for those cases and still hide it in the corers when possible. Also adjusted
    the infill to 8%.</p>

<h2>"Second Hull Satellite"</h2>

<p>All I did here was configure the seam to be on the backside/underside.</p>

<h2>"Hanger"</h2>

<p>Here again I rotated the part by 180° so the seam would be on the backside/underside.</p>

<h2>"Mid Hull"</h2>

<p>Here again I rotated the part by 180° so the seam would be on the backside/underside. I also added a support
    blocker on the inside as the support really isn't necessary. I suppose I could have adjusted the overhang tolerance
    but I wanted to play with the blocker.</p>

<h2>"Propulsion Engines"</h2>

<p>Seam alignment to "Sharpest Corner" and no support. In the final layers at about 98%, the print head caught and
    partially dislodged the engine from the bed. Thankfully it did not cause a total failure and I was able to stabilize
    it with some safety tape applied as an angle bracket. So I regenerated with brim on the inside as well as the
    outside.
    Upon closer inspection, there was some unnecessary infill which looked to be the culprit so I removed that as well
    by disabling infill.</p>

<p>I am extremely happy with the quality of this print.</p>

<h2>"Engine Caps"</h2>

<p>For the front cap, I blocked support in the middle as advised. <i>The caps look uniform so I just printed the left
    ones twice.</i></p>
<p>For the back caps, rotated the part by 180° so the seam would be on the backside/underside and enabled
    "Outer Before Inner Walls" to see if that helps with the seaming.</p>

<h2>"Arms"</h2>

<p>Used "Outer Before Inner Walls" again and set the seam alignment to "Back" / "Sharpest Corner".
    <i>The arms too look uniform so I just printed the left one twice.</i></p>

<h3>Emblem Inlay</h3>

<p>The emblem inlay was a little tricky. First it was orientated standing up so I flipped it 90° and dropped it to
    the plate. However the initial slice looked like this:</p>

<img class="screen-capture" src="emblem-raw.png"></html>

<p>A little digging and I found that setting the "Horizontal Expansion" to 0.1 mm resolved the issue:</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>This material combined with the high lighting level is both eye-popping and unforgiving because it reveals
        every imperfection. Probably an excellent candidate for testing various settings...
    </li>
    <li>The silver filament looses a tiny bit of it's sheen when printed at lower level thicknesses. This is
        due to the smoother finish produced by the thinner layer height. I prefer the way the way the light catches
        and reflects on the standard quality (0.2mm).
    </li>
    <li>Bed leveling proved to be critical as always.</li>
    <li>From the author, I came to know the hull was purposely left void so that lights could be introduced. I feel
        link maybe I'll make another attempt, prints some of the parts(ore select pieces of them) like the engine domes
        in a translucent material, cut out some of the windows, and add the lighting.
    </li>
</ul>
