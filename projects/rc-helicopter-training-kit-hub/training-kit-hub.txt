This is a simple four spoke hub which accepts 3mm rods straight on. I used [uxcell 3mm Carbon Fiber Rods] and the orange balls were actually from [another training kit] for which the hub was designed to accept the rods at a downward angle. That angle didn't work for me which is why a created this part. Note: as pictured the rods have been cut in half as I just need a little ground protection at this point ;)
