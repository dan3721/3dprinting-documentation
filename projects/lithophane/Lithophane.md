# Lithophane

Creating a lithophane directly in Cura by opening an image and orentating it along the y-axis to reduce jaring and the chance it detaches from the bed.

Manual tune flow to 120% because brim failed(traces separated) on first attempt. Also there was some bleed from the previous red filament.

## Attempt 2

Never actually used "Super Quality" yet; Let's see what that looks like...

Same image settings...
