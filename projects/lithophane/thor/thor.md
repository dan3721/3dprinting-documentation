	Width 240mm
	
### Print Settings	

	Dan's PG PLA 0.2mm
	
	Bed 	55째C
	Nozzle	200째C
	Infill	99%
	Regular Fan Speed at Layer 16
	

thor.gcode - 13h 53m / 95g

### FAILED

Too aggressive; the print was too tall and began to wobble so I abandoned it. Attempted to support with side angles but, the face also had layer defects in it which made the subject look pretty bad. The bed adhesion was also pretty bad and it lifted completely on both ends. Will try regular fan speed at layer 2 on the next print.
