<h1>General Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Do</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Do print with the lowest bed/end temperatures which still produce quality results and good adhesion in order to
        reduce the amount expansion and contraction of the material which can lead to a host of other issues.
    </li>
    <li>Do use a raft for prints whoes build plate face <b><u>is not</u></b> actually intended to be a
        bottom/resting face. This is primarily do to the tendency of the first layer to be squished into the build
        plate to achieve better adhesion. Heated beds introduce even more variance as they tend to leave that face in
        a matt finish and have a tendency to express <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#2">Elephant's
            Foot</a> no matter how well tuned. Both contribute characteristics which alter the uniformity of the first
        layer(s). Using a raft elevates your print away from them. Bearings are good candidates for raft.
    </li>
    <li>Do use a brim for prints whoes build plate face <b><u>is</u></b> actually intended to be a
        bottom/resting face. Using a brim not only increase adhesion but, offers a tab for application of
        <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#6">"Safety Tape"</a></li>
    . Vases are good candidates for brim.
    <li>Do use a rolling filament holder (see <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#7">Spool Rocking</a>).</li>
    <li>Do use <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#6">"Safety Tape"</a>. Better safe than sorry.</li>
    <li>Do know your material. Print a temperature tower for any new material(or significant change in ambient
        temperature)
        <b><u>before</u></b> actually attempting to print something with it. This will allow you to access
        the the optimal print temperature.
    </li>
    <li>Do perform a cold pull when changing filament. Additional benefits include potential removal of debris which
        has collected in the hot end. Sometimes this is not possible as the filament is locked/stuck in a cold hot end.
        In that case, preheat the nozzle, let it cool below the glass temperature of the filament and try again.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Don't</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b><u>Do not</u></b> pull filament from a hot extruder. This will greatly increase the risk of pulling alon a
        wisp of
        filament which could then clog the feed system. This is especially risky with a Bowden extruder.
    </li>
    <li><b><u>Do not</u></b> print over USB. The data transfer is not fast enough which results in poor prints.
        See <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#5">Slow Data Transfer (USB)</a>. Print from SD card.
    </li>
</ol>
