<h1>General Guidelines</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Print with the lowest bed/end temperatures that produce quality results in order to reduce the amount
        expansion and contraction in the filament which itself leads to a host of other issues.
    </li>
    <li>Use a raft for prints whoes build plate contact face it not actually intended to be a
        bottom face. This is primarily do to the tendency of the first layer to be squished into the build plate to
        achieve better adhesion. Heated beds introduce more variance as they tend to leave that face in a matt finish
        and have a tendency to express <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#2">Elephant's Foot</a> no matter
        how well tuned. Both contribute characteristics which alter the uniformity of the first layer(s). Using a
        raft elevates your print away from them. Bearings are good candidates for raft.
    </li>
    <li>Stringing is usually a result of printing too hot.</li>
    <li>Use <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#6">"Safety Tape"</a>. Better safe than sorry.</li>
    <li>Do not print over USB. The data transfer is not fast enough which results in poor prints.
        See <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#5">Slow Data Transfer (USB)</a>. Print from SD card.
    </li>
</ol>
