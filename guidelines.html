<h1>General Guidelines and Check Lists</h1>

<h2>Do</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Do regularly (after a few hours/before any larger job) level the bed. Be sure to perform the leveling <u>with
        the bed at temperature.</u></li>
    <li>Do print with the lowest bed/end temperatures which still produce quality results and good adhesion in order to
        reduce the amount expansion and contraction of the material which can lead to a host of other issues.
    </li>
    <li>Do use a raft for prints whoes build plate face <b><u>is not</u></b> actually intended to be a
        bottom/resting face. This is primarily do to the tendency of the first layer to be squished into the build
        plate to achieve better adhesion. Heated beds introduce even more variance as they tend to leave that face in
        a matt finish and have a tendency to express <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#2">Elephant's
            Foot</a> no matter how well tuned. Both contribute characteristics which alter the uniformity of the first
        layer(s). Using a raft elevates your print away from them. Bearings are good candidates for raft.
    </li>
    <li>Do use a brim for prints whoes build plate face <b><u>is</u></b> actually intended to be a
        bottom/resting face. Using a brim not only increase adhesion but, offers a tab for application of
        <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#6">"Safety Tape"</a></li>
    . Vases are good candidates for brim.
    <li>Do use a rolling filament holder (see <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#8">Spool Rocking</a>).</li>
    <li>Do use <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#6">"Safety Tape"</a>. Better safe than sorry.</li>
    <li>Do know your material. Print a temperature tower for any new material(or significant change in ambient
        temperature)
        <b><u>before</u></b> actually attempting to print something with it. This will allow you to access
        the the optimal print temperature.
    </li>
    <li>Do perform a cold pull when changing filament. Additional benefits include potential removal of debris which
        has collected in the hot end. Sometimes this is not possible as the filament is locked/stuck in a cold hot end.
        In that case, preheat the nozzle, let it cool below the glass temperature of the filament and try again.
    </li>
    <li>Do monitor the print and tune the Feed Rate if necessary. See
        <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#9">Wobbling at high Z</a></li>
    <li>Do orientate models on the bed so that the longer side is aligned with the y-axis and the shorter side
        with the x-axis. The goal is to put the majority of the short moments on the head as opposed to the bed.
        Otherwise the moments of the bed being in-line with the shorter width can induce a the model to wobble
        especially the thinner and the taller the print. The primary haul of the <a

            USS Enterprise NCC 1701</a> is a good candidate.
    </li>
    <li>Do reheat the bed if it's the first print of the day so it has time to thermally stabilize.</li>
    <li>Do use "Random" seam alignment when printing bearings (a seam creates a speed bump).</li>
    <li>Do allow the bed to cool before ~20° before attempting to dismount the piece. My bed temperature is pretty
        dialed in. At 55° C pieces stick very well and as it cools to 30° they are automagically released!
    </li>
    <li>Do use a metallic or high sheen filament when testing and trouble shooting print issues and examine
        results under high light so that all imperfections are amplified.
    </li>
    <li>Do use Silica beads to keep your filaments dry. I got <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QRRHJV3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">these</a>
        which also came with handy drawstring bags.
    </li>
    <li>Do wipe the nozzle so that any filament buildup does not negatively impact or even fail future prints. I
        usually try to do this as soon as a print finishes.
    </li>
    <li>Do handle filament with care. Ensure you hands are dry and clean.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Don't</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b><u>Do not</u></b> pull filament from a hot extruder. This will greatly increase the risk of pulling alon a
        wisp of
        filament which could then clog the feed system. This is especially risky with a Bowden extruder.
    </li>
    <li><b><u>Do not</u></b> print over USB. The data transfer is not fast enough which results in poor prints.
        See <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#5">Slow Data Transfer (USB)</a>. Print from SD card.
    </li>
    <li><b><u>Do not</u></b> handle filament with your bear hands any more than necessary.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Slicing Checklist</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure the model is optimally oriented. If it is not uniform in its x/y dimensions, rotate it so that the
        smaller dimension is aligned with the x axis.
    </li>
    <li>Select the optimal seam alignment.</li>
    <li>Inspect overhangs and determine if and where supports are needed.</li>
    <li>Set the percentage and pattern if infill is needed.</li>
    <li>From the top view transition up through the z-layers with a close eye on the outer walls. Ensure they are not
        being build chaotically. For Cura, it may be necessary to enable "Print Thin Walls".
    </li>
    <li>Is the model a vase? If yes, then enable vase mode. In Cura that means enabling "Spiralize Outer Contour" and
        "Smooth Spirialized Contours" under "Special Modes".
    </li>
</ol>

<h1>Printing Checklist</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure the bed is level. Ensure the bed is level. Ensure the bed is level.</li>
    <li>Double check the target print temperature.</li>
    <li>Preheat the bed if it's the first print of the day.</li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h1>Changing Filament</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat to 200-220° if not already hot.</li>
    <li>Depress the filament release and feed/push some through manually to induce some extrusion. Then pull the
        filament out quick and smoothly. A clean pull looks like <a href="good-pull.jpg">this</a></li>
    .
</ol>

<h1>The First Layer is <span style="color: red">Critical</span>!</h1>
<p>
    A building is only as strong as its foundation... I like to employ brims because for may reasons including
    increased build adhesion, reduced warping, nozzle priming and thermal/flow stabilization, afford tabs for
    application of <a href="troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html#6">"Safety Tape"</a>, etc. In addition, they are
    great indicators of the levelness of the bed and adhesion quality.
</p>
<p>
    Here we can see good brim lines but poor adhesion. In this case the bed temperature was too low. Raising it just
    5° resolved the issue.
</p>
<a href="good-brim-poor-adhesion.jpg"><img width="200" src="good-brim-poor-adhesion.jpg"/></a>
<p>
    Watch to ensure brim lines are laying and bonding well. There should be no gaps or thinning between the
    concentric rings. Additionally they should be smooth and uniform.

<h1>Ancillaries</h1>

<h2>Silica Beads</h2>
